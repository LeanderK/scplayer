# scplayer - Spotify Connect Player
Open source client of Spotify Connect closed library developed in Java

I decided to make a Java version because i needed the player to run without any privileged or any additional installation.

Why: I have to run on the same Raspberry that my media center, in this case Kodi, that i run over Openelec. As Openelec is built only to run Kodi (and that what makes it so good) and i didn't wanna mess up everything rebuilding the whole system to allow to install other packages ruining all. So I decided to develop a java version which fit perfect the requirement (No privileged, No installation, No additional libs).
